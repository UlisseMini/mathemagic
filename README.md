# Mathemagic

A project to make an actually good mental math trainer, for things useful in everyday life.

Here's an arbitrary feature matrix, I'm only comparing against [mathtrainer.io](https://mathtrainer.io) as it was the only decent thing I could find.

## Feature wishlist

An arbitrary rant about what features would best allow you to [deliberately practice](https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory) mental math, in a way that's actually useful.

- Adjust difficulty automatically
- Verbal questions, more realistic and more intensive on memory.
- Punish mistakes, aim for 100% accuracy. If you don't do this people will learn bad guessing habits
- Estimation problems with required error bounds. e.g. I want to be able to say my answer is correct up to 1% error.
- Time limited mode, aim for high accuracy while decreasing amount of time on questions.
- Custom training for power users, be able to drill multiplication only if desired
